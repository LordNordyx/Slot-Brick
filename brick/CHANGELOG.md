# Changelog — Slot. for TrimUI Brick

## v0.40
**New since v0.23:**
- Wifi status icon on the shelf footer. Icons may change.
- Label Picker. Press Y when in the edit screen on a game cart. It has a label editor built in, so you can resize the label and make it fit the cart cutout
- Finally fixed Wi-Fi
- Customize cartridges: color, finish and shape for all shelves.
- Add SNES support: SNES and PAL cartridges
- Add NES support: NES and FAMICOM Cartridges
- Add RetroAchievements support, softcore only
- Automatic label fetcher in main menu, it fetches labels for all carts at once, but it is really barebones, so refer to the label picker for more control

**FOR DEVELOPERS**
- The Brick simulator - for testing in the browser before real hardware testing. Refer to the Development part of the Readme.

## v0.23
- Settings > About credits the port to LordNordyx.
- Short app names in the stock Apps list: Slot, Logo, Check and Stock, each with its own icon.
  Folder names are unchanged, so existing Apps/BootLogo/Image pictures keep working.
- Card README rewritten with the Brick's actual button layout (HOME = left button, SELECT = middle).
- Removed leftovers: the old Tools/tg5040/Slot.pak launcher and the RetroAchievements research note.

## v0.22.2
- Fixed "works once, then stock menu": the startup hook now waits until the real SD card is
  mounted instead of reading a stray Slot folder on internal storage.
- Check lists files hidden under the card mount on internal storage.

## v0.22.1
- The startup hook waits up to 30 s (was 10 s) for slow-mounting cards and logs each decision
  to Slot/Logs/hook.log.

## v0.22
- A read-only or damaged card no longer drops silently to the stock menu; Slot shows
  "Can't write to SD card".
- Check writes startup-report.txt at the top of the card.

## v0.21
- Fixed autostart failing after a firmware update or reinstall.
- New Check app: read-only startup report.

## v0.17 – v0.20
- SELECT + X switches GBA between 3:2 and 4:3 full screen, remembered per game.
- About screen describes the Brick port.

## v0.16
- Waking no longer needs two Power presses; Wi-Fi reconnects in the background.

## v0.15
- Merged upstream Slot 1.6.0: GB cartridge clocks kept in saves, read-only card alarm, faster
  library loading, shuffled wallpapers, crash logs.
- Boot Logo app (now Logo) replaces the separate install/restore logo apps.

## v0.14
- Lower sleep drain: radios off during suspend, real suspend-to-RAM where available.

## v0.13
- Auto-sleep after 5 min idle in menus or 15 min in game (Slot/DISABLE_AUTO_SLEEP turns it off).

## v0.12
- Wi-Fi works on stock firmware; minimum CPU clock in games fixes crackling audio.

Earlier versions: Brick screen, input, LEDs, power menu and autostart (see SOURCES.md).
